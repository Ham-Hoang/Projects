                <h6><br>This web application was created by Hamilton Hoang, Luke Kovacs, and Perminder Singh for CIS 4339 Spring 2022.</h6> 
        <p><br> Our goal with this
    full stack web application was to build an application that serves a single point for the organizations Community Family Centers (CFC) and 
    Bread of Life. <br> Our application allows you to move through the tabs to view, edit, delete, and create new indexes to any of the tables.</p>
    <p>>We designed this application to make it as simple and easy for anyone to use with no training needed. <br/><br/><br/></p>
